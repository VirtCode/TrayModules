# TrayModules
This Repository contains all official modules for the [TrayUtils Software](https://github.com/VirtCode/TrayUtils "TrayUtils on Github"). Consider looking at that project since all modules here are based on and require that project to run at all.
## Modules
Currently, there are 3 different Modules available in this repository. These are (or at least should) be made by various different developers. You can find out basic information about each of the modules down below. Here is some more information about the captions:<br>
* *Experimental* - Experimental means, that this module is (highly) unstable and should be used with care. This means that there could be some serious bugs and problems.<br>
* *Resource Usage* - The Resource Usage indicates how resource intensive a module is. This usally is estimated by the developer and depends on various factors. These assumptions are made relative to other modules and their resouce usage.
### Color Picker
*Author: Virt, Current Version: 1.0, Compatible with: 1.2, Resource Usage: Minimal* <br>
Color Picker is a Module that acts as a system wide color picker. If you press its keybind you can click on the screen to select the color you are hovering. Once you have selected a color, it's Hex-Value is copied into your clipboard.
### Second Clipboard
**[Experimental]** *Author: Virt, Current Version: 1.0, Compatible with: 1.2, Resource Usage: Low* <br>
Second Clipboard is a Module that tries to provide a second clipboard to your system. It does have other configurable Keybinds to do actions like copy or paste to or from that clipboard. It should work just like the real clipboard though with a slight delay. Be aware though that this addon does sometimes behave wierdly, as for example pasting or cutting things multiple times, which can lead to serious issues. This addon is experimental. Use it at your own risk.
### Window Tracker
*Author: Virt, Current Version: 0.8, Compatible with: 1.2, Resource Usage: Medium* <br>
Window Tracker is a Module that basically tracks your time on focused windows. It saves the collected data in json. Currently there is no inbuilt viewer for the collected data. There will also be options to change the check interval. Unfortunately, this addons only works on Windows, since it requires native bindings to fetch the window data.
